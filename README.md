# TrueSight Pulse Nginx Plus Plugin

A Nginx plugin that collects metrics from an Nginx Plus instance. This plugin is not intended for the Nginx F/OSS edition as fewer metrics are available there.

### Prerequisites

#### Supported OS

|     OS    | Linux | Windows | SmartOS | OS X |
|:----------|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|:----:|
| Supported |   v   |    v    |    v    |  v   |

#### Boundary Meter versions v4.2 or later 

- To install new meter go to Settings->Installation or [see instructions](https://help.boundary.com/hc/en-us/sections/200634331-Installation). 
- To upgrade the meter to the latest version - [see instructions](https://help.boundary.com/hc/en-us/articles/201573102-Upgrading-the-Boundary-Meter).

### Plugin Setup

To enable collecting metrics per virtual server, you need to enable zones. See Nginx documentation for more details about [status_zone](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html#status_zone) directive. Several virtual servers may share the same zone.

    ```
    status_zone <your-zone-goes-here>;
    ```

Once you make the update, reload your nginx configuration:
    ```bash
     $ sudo service nginx reload
    ```

#### Verify `HttpStatusModule` is Collecting Statistics

Run the following command, which shows the expected output:
    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:8000/status
    {JSON Output here}
    ```
You can see an example of the output [here](http://demo.nginx.com/status)
